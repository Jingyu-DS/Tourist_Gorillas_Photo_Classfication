#### Summary of other animal cases
For panda: there are three violation images and one non-violation image added into the testing set when training and validating with gorilla images. The four images are classified correctly. 

For lion/tiger: there are five violation images added into testing set when training and validating with gorilla images. The five images are classified correctly. 

For giraffe: there are four non-violation images added into testing set when training and validating with gorilla images. The four images are classified wrongly. When the animals are more and more different from gorillas in, for example, body structure or characteristics, the transfer learning starts getting worse. 

For elephant: there are seven violation images and six non-violation images added into the testing set when training and validating with gorilla images. All violation images are classified correcly but only one out of six non-violation images is classified correctly. The potential reason we suspect is still that the characteristics of elephants are too different from gorillas.
