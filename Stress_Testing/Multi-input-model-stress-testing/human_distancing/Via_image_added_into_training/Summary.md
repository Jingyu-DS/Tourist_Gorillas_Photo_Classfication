For this stress testing on human distancing images, 10 violation images and 10 non-violation images are added into the training data to train together with gorilla images. In the testing data set, 8 human distancing images in each group has been tested: all violation images are classified correctly, 6 out of 8 non-violation images are classified correctly. The model performance has been increased compared with the predictions in transfer learning case. This further shows the model can be generalized if training with diverse data. Transfer learing can work in some particular cases but not always.
