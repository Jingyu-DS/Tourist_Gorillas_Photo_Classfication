Our model has been implemented on the popular topic, human distancing, as well to figure out the generalization. There are two testing logics implemented: one is via transfer learning, training on gorilla images and testing on human distancing images. The other is adding human distancing images into training data set and testing on human distancing images. The first one does not work really well but not too bad, to be honest. The second one shows obvious improvement from the first one. The purpose of doing these two expriments is to show the model can be generalized to work in different cases. The transfer learning can work in some particular cases but not always. Check each folder to see the data and code there.
