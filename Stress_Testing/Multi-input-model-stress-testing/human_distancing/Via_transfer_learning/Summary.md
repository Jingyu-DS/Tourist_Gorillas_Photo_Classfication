This stess test on human distancing is using transfer learning. The training and validation data sets are still gorilla images, but we add seven violation images and 6 non-violation images into testing dataset. However, the transfer learning cannot work really well in the human distancing case. Four of seven violation images are classified correctly. Five out of six non-violation images are classified correctly. The result is not too bad. But we are wondering whether adding some images to the training data can enhance the model performance and further show that the model is great, just transfer learning not working well.
