### Summary of stress tesing on ensemblem deep learning model
Some of the direct stress testing were in the ensemble model folder, just after the ensemble model were trained, a few other test datsets were tested to see the model's performance.

Direct Stress testing with just testing on a different dataset is proved to be not performing well on the ensemble model. After training on the mixed data, a few testing data loaders were created to do the stress testing. However, the performance of the testing data on other animals and human-human pictures were not performing well. Therefore, we thought of using transfer learning method. To use our model trained previously on the mixed dataset, load it saved weights, train on the new dataset and test to see its performance.
Reproduction of the ensemble model is successfully completed for the ensemble models. Since this is an ensemble model with 5 different models, saving only the weights for the ensemble model is not enough. Therefore, weights for DenseNet161, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, Vgg-16, and VGG19_bn also need to be saved and downloaded. After creating the same checkpoint for the models, the “pth” file that contains all the weights can be then loaded into the environment for future use. This reproduced ensemble model will be used for stress testing. In this case, we conclude with version 3 for transfer learning on giraffes, panthers, and human-human images.
